To run the server (in a UNIX environment with the bash shell), use

$ ./runserver <port>

where port is a positive integer > 1023. To run the server on a different
environment, use

$ node js/dispatcher.js <node>

To interact with the server with your internet browser, browse host:port
where host is the hostname of the machine you are running the server
from, and port is the port you specified. For example, if running
the server on csc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca with port 5678, browse to

csc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca:5678

or even just

csc:5678

if you are running your browser on a machine which is within the cpsc network.
