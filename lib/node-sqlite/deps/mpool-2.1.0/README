BACKGROUND:

This is a memory pool library which was written to allow a program to
have heaps that it could destroy without fragmenting memory.  You can
have multiple heaps and reset them easily completely reclaiming the
memory (as opposed to standard heaps).

With it you can mpool_open() a new heap, then mpool_alloc(),
mpool_calloc(), mpool_realloc(), mpool_free() to your heart's content.
Once you are done with the memory-pool you can run mpool_clear() or
mpool_close() and completely remove the memory associated with the
pools.  This is very handy if you are working with some large blocks
of memory and want to reset back to a clean state.

Check out the mpool.h file for more information.  Sorry for minimal
docs.

INSTALLATION:

1) Typing 'make' should be enough to build libskip.a.
2) Typing 'make tests' should make the mpool_t test program.
