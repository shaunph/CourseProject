# You can use this script as a template for your unit tests.
# Replace examples.js with the name of your main test file that
# runs all your other tests. Please refer to NodeUnitTesting.pdf
# for more information.
#
# If you are having trouble executing new scripts, make sure you
# enable execute permissions. Try:
# chmod 755 <your script>.sh
#
# Please keep the format of your main test as follows:
# <project directory>/<tests>/<your test name>/<your test name>.js
# For now, I'm planning to have this format so that all tests may
# be run in one command later on.
